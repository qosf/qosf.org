## The world's first conference for quantum software engineers

---

Open source software for quantum computing is growing faster than ever and it becomes increasingly difficult to stay on top of the newest developments. The inaugural quantum track at FOSDEM aims to bring together quantum software engineers from academia & industry as well as traditional open source developers in order to provide a space to share new developments, features and libraries for quantum computing applications. Think of it as PyCon for quantum computing!

The main themes of the event are:

- to promote existing quantum computing open source projects and foster
  collaboration between new and existing developers
- to flatten down the learning curve and break perceived barriers that prevent
  developers from entering the field of quantum software development
- to ensure that the field is dominated by high-quality, community driven FOSS
  open source software, standards and protocols

Past speakers included:

- Robert Smith (Rigetti)
- Shahnawaz Ahmed (QuTip)
- Alexander Condello & Radomir Stevanovic (D-Wave)
- Nathan Killoran & Josh Izaac (Xanadu)
- Kevin Kissell (Google)
- Mark Mattingley-Scott (IBM)
- Will Zeng (Unitary Fund)

# Apply as a speaker

*Have you started an open source quantum software repo or are you a top-committer or maintainer of one?*

**or**

*Are you working for a quantum software company that is partly developing open source?*

If the answer is YES, then we would love to hear from you! We still have a few speaker slots available for FOSDEM 2020. Join us for two packed days full of quantum computing, celebrating open source and fostering collaboration at [FOSDEM 2020](https://fosdem.org/2020/).

Before applying, please take a moment to read the [FOSDEM Code of Conduct](https://fosdem.org/2020/practical/conduct/).

**To apply email:** [fosdem20@qosf.org](mailto:fosdem20@qosf.org) with the subject of your talk.
