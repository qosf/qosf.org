##### **Parallel and distributed low-depth algorithms for quantum amplitude estimation** 

*Project description*: Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) is a core subroutine in quantum computation with various applications, including Monte Carlo integration. Quantum computers can potentially utilize QAE to achieve quadratic speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo. In the conventional approach, the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm is used for amplitude estimation; however, QPE requires expensive controlled operations as well as a Fourier transform, which currently lead to difficulties with implementation in near-term quantum devices. In response to this, some alternative lower depth algorithms have been developed. In this project, I focused on implementing a parallelized and distributed version of the Power Law algorithm for QAE, which should further reduce the current hardware challenges by interconnecting small quantum computers as opposed to relying on a single big quantum computer.
