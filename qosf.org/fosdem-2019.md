## FOSDEM&#39;19 Quantum Computing

_Are you interested in Quantum Computing? Unsure where the industry's heading? Is the
hype justified? And when are quantum computers going to take over the world?_

**or**

_Are you a developer interested in jumping on the rising tide of the new
computing paradigm?_

---

Join us for two packed days full of quantum computing, celebrating open source
and fostering collaboration at [FOSDEM 2019](https://fosdem.org/2019/) and
learn answers to (not only!) those questions.

The space of the open source software for quantum computing is blooming,
with researchers and hardware providers alike investing in creating
software infrastructure for this new computing paradigm.

The main themes of the event are:

- to flatten down the learning curve and break perceived barriers that prevent
  developers from entering the field of quantum software development
- to promote existing quantum computing open source projects and foster
  collaboration between new and existing developers
- to ensure that the field is dominated by high-quality, community driven FOSS
  open source software, standards and protocols

All major hardware providers with open source development frameworks, including
[Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) (IBM),
[Forest](https://www.rigetti.com/forest) (Rigetti), 
[D-Wave's Ocean](https://ocean.dwavesys.com/) (D-Wave), 
[PennyLane](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[Strawberry Fields](https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Xanadu),
[QuTiP](http://qutip.org/),
[Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq) (Google),
and a vast number of academic and independent open source projects will be featured over the two days. 

If you are inclined to learn more from directly from engineers and researchers
working on the forefront of quantum computing software, join the community and
contribute to pushing the limits of the quantum computing open source, there's no
better place than here!

## Overview

### Saturday: Quantum computing devroom
Saturday is devoted to quantum computing full-stack libraries and established, mature quantum computing projects.
Attendees are free to come and go in-between the talks, but beware that rooms at FOSDEM can get crowded!
This day will also include a discussion on the state of open source and possible directions going forward with respect to development of open source and open standards.

### Sunday: Quantum computing workshop
Sunday is hands-on day: we're organizing a **quantum computing workshop**! In the morning, developers of 11 open source quantum computing projects in total will introduce attendees of the workshop to their projects.
During the afternoon, participants of the workshop (yes, you!) will work in small groups with the developers of the selected project to work learn more about the respective projects, help improve the documentation or even work on their first contributions!

Participants of the Quantum computing workshop are generally expected to attend the whole day - the space is limited. If you want a better chance to get a spot, [pre-register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmbT0L2lDeMOhcLmSEmif-dqkuCg_EV0S7RkP4RJxZy5ksyQ/viewform).
